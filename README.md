We are creating an educational platform for VNIT Nagpur. This platform will allow students/users to upload their 3D models related to specific topics or departments. This will help students and professors in those fields to visualize the diagrams in 3D, leading to a deeper understanding of the concept.

The 3D models that users upload to our platform These models are created using Spline, a web-based design tool that offers a range of features including the ability to create 3D models, animations, and interactive experiences. Spline's user-friendly interface allows for quick manipulation of 3D objects, and it also provides pre-made models, textures, and animations to assist users in getting started with their designs. Moreover, Spline offers collaboration tools for real-time project work, making it particularly useful for remote teams. With its features and capabilities, Spline is an excellent tool for game design, product prototyping, and other similar tasks.
