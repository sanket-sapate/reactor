            <p className="mx-2 my-6 sm:mx-0 sm:mr-24 leading-7 "> We are creating an educational platform for VNIT Nagpur. This platform will allow students/users to upload their 3D models related to specific topics or departments. This will help students and professors in those fields to visualize the diagrams in 3D, leading to a deeper understanding of the concept. </p>
            <p className="mx-2 my-6 sm:mx-0 sm:mr-24 leading-7 "> The 3D models that users upload to our platform These models are created using Spline, a web-based design tool that offers a range of features including the ability to create 3D models, animations, and interactive experiences. Spline's user-friendly interface allows for quick manipulation of 3D objects, and it also provides pre-made models, textures, and animations to assist users in getting started with their designs. Moreover, Spline offers collaboration tools for real-time project work, making it particularly useful for remote teams. With its features and capabilities, Spline is an excellent tool for game design, product prototyping, and other similar tasks. </p>
            <p className="mx-2 my-6 sm:mx-0 sm:mr-24 leading-7 "> I would like to explain the role of users on our platform. There are two types of users: internal users, who are either from VNIT Nagpur or are its alumni, and external users, who can be students from various academic backgrounds such as undergraduates, postgraduates, diploma holders, as well as working professionals, professors, and engineers, among others. </p>
            <p className="mx-2 my-6 sm:mx-0 sm:mr-24 leading-7 "> Let me explain how the sharing and collaboration of 3D models will work on our platform. Students or users can upload their 3D models related to specific topics or departments, which will then undergo a review process by the internal authorities or appointed members of VNIT Nagpur. Once the 3D model is approved, it will be displayed on the platform with the creator's name mentioned below it, such as "created by the creator - _______". As you may be aware, Udemy issues certificates to learners upon completion of a course, which can then be uploaded to LinkedIn or a resume along with the relevant credentials. Similarly, we can also provide credentials to users upon acceptance of their 3D models, which would be beneficial to the user. </p>
